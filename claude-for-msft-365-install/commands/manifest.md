description: Generate the add-in manifest XML with your cloud config baked in
---

# Generate add-in manifest

The script fetches the canonical manifest and appends your config as URL query
parameters. The add-in reads them at startup. Outlook uses a separate template
because Microsoft's `MailApp` schema is distinct from the `TaskPaneApp` schema
Excel/Word/PowerPoint share, so ask which apps they're deploying and generate
one file per host.

| Host arg | Apps | Template |
|---|---|---|
| `office` | Excel, Word, PowerPoint | `pivot.claude.ai/manifest.xml` |
| `outlook` | Outlook (mail + calendar) | `pivot.claude.ai/manifest-outlook-3p.xml` |

## Keys by cloud

Prompt only for the keys their cloud path needs. Don't ask for all eight.

| Cloud | Keys |
|---|---|
| Vertex | `gcp_project_id` `gcp_region` `google_client_id` `google_client_secret` |
| Bedrock | `aws_role_arn` `aws_region` |
| Foundry | `azure_resource_name` `azure_api_key` |
| Gateway | `gateway_url` `gateway_token` `gateway_auth_header` `gateway_api_format` |
| Gateway (`gateway_api_format=vertex`) | also `gcp_project_id` `gcp_region` |

Amazon Bedrock is **not currently supported for the `outlook` host**; the script
exits with an error if you pass `aws_*` keys with `outlook`.

## Outlook — Microsoft Graph

Outlook reads the user's mailbox and calendar via Microsoft Graph, which
requires a one-time tenant-wide admin consent regardless of which cloud serves
the model. Run [consent](consent.md#outlook--microsoft-graph-consent) before
deploying — otherwise every user hits "Need admin approval" on first open.

If their policy forbids consenting to a third-party app, prompt for
`graph_client_id` (their own single-tenant Entra app's client ID with
Mail.ReadWrite, Calendars.Read, People.Read, User.Read, offline_access
delegated permissions and admin consent granted). Otherwise leave it unset and
the add-in uses Anthropic's multi-tenant app.

## Entra SSO

`entra_sso=1` makes the add-in acquire an Entra ID token at startup. Set it
when your deployment needs the user's Microsoft identity — Bedrock uses it as
the STS web identity, the bootstrap endpoint uses it as Bearer auth, and
per-user attrs ([update-user-attrs](update-user-attrs.md)) ride inside it as
`extn.*` claims.

**Admin consent is a prerequisite.** Without it, every user hits a Microsoft
consent dialog on first open. Run [consent](consent.md) first so
`entra_sso=1` is silent for your users.

If you don't need Entra — static gateway config, Vertex with Google OAuth —
leave it off. Users won't see a Microsoft prompt for a setup that doesn't
involve Microsoft.

**Bring your own Entra app.** By default the token is requested as Anthropic's
multi-tenant app (`c2995f31-…`), so its `aud` claim is that GUID. If your
bootstrap endpoint or token-exchange service requires `aud` to match an app
registered in *your* tenant, set `graph_client_id=<your-app-guid>`. Register
the app in Entra as a single-tenant **Single-page application** with redirect
URI `https://pivot.claude.ai/msal-redirect.html`. You handle consent on your
own app — [consent](consent.md) covers the default app only.

**Send an access token instead of the ID token.** With `graph_client_id` alone
the add-in still sends an *ID token* to your bootstrap endpoint — `aud` is your
app's GUID, but there's no `scp` claim. If your endpoint is a standard OAuth2
protected resource that validates `aud` + `scp`, or an RFC 8693 token-exchange
service, set `entra_scope=api://<your-app-guid>/<scope>` and the add-in
requests an *access token* for that scope instead. The Bearer it sends carries
`aud` = your API's App ID URI and `scp` = the granted scope. In Entra, on your
app registration: **Expose an API** (Application ID URI `api://<guid>`), add a
scope such as `access_as_user`, and grant the same app delegated permission to
it, then grant admin consent for the tenant. In the app manifest, set
`accessTokenAcceptedVersion: 2` so the issued token uses v2.0 claims
(`iss = login.microsoftonline.com/<tid>/v2.0`, `azp`, `preferred_username`);
leave it unset and you get v1.0 tokens, which your validator may reject.
`/.default` (requests all consented scopes) also works.

**Multiple scopes.** `entra_scope` accepts a comma- or whitespace-separated
list — `entra_scope=api://<guid>/use_llm,api://<guid>/admin`. All scopes must
target the **same resource**: one access token has one `aud`, so MSAL cannot
mint a token spanning two APIs (`api://torii/x,api://other/y` will fail or
silently honor only one). The Bearer's `scp` claim is the space-joined list.
If you need every consented scope, prefer `/.default` over enumerating them.

`entra_scope` requires `graph_client_id` — the build script enforces *that
pairing* but not the scope string itself: any non-blank value is accepted and
Entra validates the syntax at sign-in (a malformed scope surfaces as an
`AADSTS` error, not a build failure). Both keys are manifest-only: the add-in
needs them to initialize NAA *before* it can read extension attrs or call your
bootstrap endpoint, so neither can arrive through those layers. Leave
`entra_scope` unset and the ID token is sent.

## Bootstrap endpoint

`bootstrap_url` points to an HTTPS endpoint you host. At startup the add-in
fetches per-user JSON from it — provider keys, `mcp_servers`, `skills` — and
the response overrides manifest values for that user. The URL itself is
[interpolated](bootstrap.md#template-interpolation) against manifest + attrs
before the fetch, so one endpoint can branch on a query param.

See [bootstrap](bootstrap.md) for the request/response contract, JWT
validation, and handler scaffolding.

## MCP servers

`mcp_servers` is a JSON array of customer-hosted MCP servers the add-in
connects to directly. Each entry is `{url, label, headers?, discover?}` —
`headers` present means static auth; absent triggers OAuth discovery. Values
interpolate other config keys via `{{gateway_url}}`-style templates.

Setting it here applies one list org-wide; per-user lists belong in
[bootstrap](bootstrap.md#mcp_servers), which also has the full schema. The
value is JSON inside a shell arg — single-quote it:

```bash
mcp_servers='[{"url":"{{gateway_url}}/deepwiki/mcp","label":"DeepWiki","headers":{"Authorization":"Bearer {{gateway_token}}"}}]'
```

## Telemetry

`otlp_endpoint` routes the add-in's OpenTelemetry traces to a collector you
operate. Set it to the collector's base HTTPS URL — the add-in appends
`/v1/traces` and posts OTLP/HTTP. gRPC isn't supported (the add-in runs in a
browser WebView). Leave it unset and no custom collector is configured.

`otlp_headers` supplies authentication headers for that collector, in the same
`key1=value1,key2=value2` format as the standard
`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` variable. URL-encode the value in the manifest.

`otlp_resource_attributes` adds attributes to the OpenTelemetry Resource on
every span, in the same `key1=value1,key2=value2` format as the standard
`OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` variable. Use this when your collector requires
specific resource attributes for routing or attribution (e.g.
`team.name=platform,deployment.environment=prod`). The add-in already sets
`service.name`, `service.version`, and `git.sha`; values you provide here are
merged on top.

Setting these here applies one collector org-wide; per-user routing belongs in
[bootstrap](bootstrap.md#telemetry) or extension attrs.

## Inference headers

`inference_headers` is a JSON object of extra HTTP headers the add-in attaches
to every request it sends to your gateway (`gateway_url`). Use it for
accounting or cost-allocation tags your gateway expects — e.g., an internal
application ID — so you don't need a header-injecting proxy in front of it.
Applies only when using a gateway; direct cloud connections ignore it.

```bash
inference_headers='{"x-application-id":"app123"}'
```

The add-in treats the values as opaque. `Authorization`, `x-api-key`,
`Content-Type`, `Host`, `Content-Length`, `User-Agent`, `Cookie`, and any
`anthropic-*` / `x-amz-*` / `x-goog-*` header are reserved and silently dropped
— they carry the add-in's own auth and protocol negotiation.

Setting it here applies one header set org-wide; per-user values belong in
[bootstrap](bootstrap.md#inference_headers).

## Auto-connect

Default: when all fields for a provider are set, users skip the connection form
and land straight in chat. Ask: should they instead see the form first
(prefilled, one click)? Yes → `auto_connect=0`.

## Allow Claude.ai sign-in

When any enterprise config key is present, users land on the enterprise
connection screen and the **Back** button to Claude.ai sign-in is hidden
(`allow_1p=0`, the default). Set `allow_1p=1` to keep the **Back** button.

## Disabled features

`disabled_features` is a comma-separated list of feature slugs the admin wants
locked for users. Slugs use `<domain>.<action>` form. Currently enforced:

| Slug | Effect |
|---|---|
| `skills.authoring` | Blocks creating, editing, and uploading skills (create/update tools, `/skillify`, `.skill` upload + drag-drop, skill editing UI). Running admin-provisioned skills is unaffected. |

```bash
disabled_features='skills.authoring'
```

Unknown slugs are ignored (forward-compatible). Setting it here applies one
policy org-wide; per-user policy belongs in [bootstrap](bootstrap.md#disabled_features)
(JSON array) or extension attrs (comma-separated).

## Version

M365 Admin Center caches by `<Id>` + `<Version>` — re-upload with the same
version is silently ignored. After the script writes `manifest.xml`, ask whether
this replaces an existing deployment; if yes, edit `<Version>` to bump the
fourth segment past their last deployed value. First deploy can leave the
template's version as-is.

## Run

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/build-manifest.mjs" office manifest.xml \
  gcp_project_id=<value> \
  gcp_region=<value> \
  auto_connect=0 \
  ...

# and if they're also deploying Outlook:
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/build-manifest.mjs" outlook manifest-outlook.xml \
  <same provider keys as above> \
  graph_client_id=<value>   # only if NOT using Anthropic's app via the consent URL
```

The script validates key names (unknown keys fail hard) and shape-hints values
(warns but doesn't block — their infra may look different).

## Validate

```bash
npx --yes office-addin-manifest validate manifest.xml
```

If validation passes but M365 Admin Center still rejects or ignores the upload,
match the symptom below. Edit `manifest.xml` directly, then re-validate.

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| "An add-in with this ID already exists" | Replace the text inside `<Id>` with a fresh UUID. The template carries the marketplace install's ID. |
| Re-upload accepted but nothing changes | M365 caches by ID + version. Edit `<Version>` to a higher fourth segment (e.g. `1.0.0.9` → `1.0.0.10`) and re-validate. |
| Only want Excel (not PowerPoint) | Remove `<Host>` elements for `Presentation`. **Two parallel lists:** the top-level `<Hosts>` uses `Name="Presentation"`, the one under `<VersionOverrides>` uses `xsi:type="Presentation"` — both must go or the manifest is inconsistent. The `xsi:type` block is multi-line, delete the whole `<Host xsi:type="Presentation">...</Host>`. |
| Only want Excel/PPT, not Outlook | Nothing to remove — Outlook is a separate file. Just don't generate it. |
